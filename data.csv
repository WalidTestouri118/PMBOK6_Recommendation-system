11.,project risk managment,"project risk management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis,  response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. the objectives of project risk management  are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative  risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success. the project risk management processes are: 11.1 plan risk managementthe process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. 11.2

presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in ways that  cannot be completely detailed in this pmbok guide.not for not for distribution, sale or reproduction. key concepts for project risk management all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver  benefits. they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that  may be conflicting and changing. organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner  in order to create value while balancing risk and reward. project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management  processes. when unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to  achieve the defined project objectives. consequently, the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related  to project success. risk exists at two levels within every project. each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of  project objectives. it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination  of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. project risk management processes address both levels of  risk in projects, and these are defined as follows:  individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on  one or more project objectives.  overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty  including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project  outcome, both positive and negative. individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. project risk  management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks  (threats). unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall,  or loss of reputation. opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved  performance, or reputation. overall project risk can also be positive or negative. management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk  exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation,  and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.not for distribution, sale or reproduction. risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so project risk management processes should be conducted  iteratively. risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. risk should also be monitored and  managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed. in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure  is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. this is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk  appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around  a project objective. they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of  risk impact levels for the project. trends and emerging practices in project risk management the focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project  risks are understood in a wider context. trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are  not limited to:  non-event risks. most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur.  examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may  change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard  operating processes. there is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed. there are two main  types of non-event risks:  variability risk. uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision.  examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found  during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the  construction phase.  ambiguity risk. uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. areas of the project where  imperfect knowledge might affect the project ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the  requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic  complexity in the project.not for distribution, sale or reproduction. variability risks can be addressed using monte carlo analysis, with the range of variation reflected in probability  distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. ambiguity risks are managed by  defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding, then filling the gap by obtaining  expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. ambiguity is also addressed through incremental  development, prototyping, or simulation.  project resilience. the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called  unknowable-unknowns. these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. emergent risks  can be tackled through developing project resilience. this requires each project to have:  right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a specific risk budget for  known risks;  flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project  goals, including strong change management;  empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed- upon limits;  frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and  clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response  to emergent risks.  integrated risk management. projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program  or portfolio. risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level.  some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project  risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. a coordinated approach to  enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels.  this builds risk efficiency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a  given level of risk exposure.not for distribution, sale or reproduction. tailoring considerations because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied.  considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:  project size. does the project size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed  approach to risk management? or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process?  project complexity. is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial  arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? or is the project simple  enough that a reduced risk process will suffice?  project importance. how strategically important is the project? is the level of risk increased for this project  because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses significant blocks to organizational  performance, or involves major product innovation?  development approach. is this a waterfall project, where risk processes can be followed sequentially and  iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as  well as during its execution? tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management  process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan. considerations for agile/adaptive environments high-variability environments, by definition, incur more uncertainty and risk. to address this, projects managed using  adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to  accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. risk is considered when selecting the  content of each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and managed during each iteration. additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized  as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.",['https://i.ibb.co/JtWQnYR/figure-11-0.png'],['figure 11-1'],"

11.4.2.5,data analysis,"data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:  simulation. quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. simulations are typically performed using a monte carlo analysis. when running a monte carlo analysis for cost risk, the simulation uses the project cost estimates. when running a monte carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. an integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses both inputs. the output is a quantitative risk analysis model. computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. the input values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random for each iteration. outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g., project end date, project cost at completion). typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (s-curve) representing the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. an example s-curve from a monte carlo cost risk analysis is shown in .noreproduction. for a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. a criticality index is calculated for each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. the output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the project.  sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. it correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence the project outcome. this can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or specific sources of ambiguity. items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance. an example tornado diagram is shown in .nouction.  decision tree analysis. decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both threats and opportunities). the end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path, which can be negative or positive. the decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal path to be selected. an example decision tree is shown in .not fonot for distribution, sale or reproduction.  influence diagrams. influence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. an influence diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and influences, together with the relationships and effects between them. where an element in the influence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the influence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. the influence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as monte carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence on key outcomes. outputs from an influence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, including s-curves and tornado diagrams.","['https://i.ibb.co/Ms825Md/figure-11-13.png', 'https://i.ibb.co/gwqZGs6/figure-11-14.png', 'https://i.ibb.co/CzryBVw/figure-11-15.png']","['figure 11-13', 'figure 11-14', 'figure 11-15']","

11.5.2.5,strategies for opportunities,"five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:  escalate. this risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager authority. escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the project level. the project manager determines who should be notified about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. it is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.  exploit. the exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.  share. sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. it is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.  enhance. the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred. the probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. where it is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit. examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early.  accept. accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. this strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly.not for distribution, sale or reproduction.",[],[],"
